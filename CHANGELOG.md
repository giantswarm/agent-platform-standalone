## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `hack/curate.sh`, the generator that produces `Chart.yaml`, `Chart.lock` and `values.yaml` from the `agent-platform` fleet chart through a deny-unknown transform configured in `curate.yaml` and `overlay/vanilla.yaml`.
- Umbrella chart with one dependency per component (`muster`, `valkey`, `kagent`, `agentgateway`, `agent-platform-mcps`, `klaus-gateway`, `dicebear`, `agent-sandbox`, `backstage`, `cloudnative-pg`), toggled by `components.<name>.enabled`, pinned to exact versions.
- Wiring templates (routes, agentgateway data-plane Gateway, network policies, kagent CRs, CloudNativePG Cluster) copied from `agent-platform-connectivity` and rewired to the umbrella values layout.
- `values.schema.json`, strict for the umbrella-owned keys, opaque for component blocks.
- `examples/kind-lab-dex.yaml` and the `verify` CI job (`make verify`).
